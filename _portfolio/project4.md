NFT standards on other chains only allow the inclusion of a single location to store an image or asset â€“ usually this is an IPFS or Arweave link. If the asset changes location or the link is no longer available in the future, the NFT is essentially broken. **Chia NFT1 standard allows multiple redundant URIs** as well as the ability for the NFT owner to append additional URIs with matching data hash at any time to ensure better digital permanence. This extends to the metadata and license URIs as well.
