Decentralized Identifier (DID) Profiles in Chia are a way for creators and collectors to identify themselves online. A DID can optionally be associated and verified with external linkages such as social media accounts and other real-world identifiers. **This allows creators to attach provenance to the history and origin of an NFT to distinguish authentic collections from copycats.**

The added provenance of who created the NFT, who has owned the NFT in the past, and who currently owns the NFT is recorded on-chain and becomes part of the NFT itself. Imagine a house or a painting that was previously owned by a notable person or was part of an historic event â€“ that provenance adds a rich story and potential value to the asset.
