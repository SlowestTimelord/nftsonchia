Decentralized Identifier (DID) Profiles in Chia are a way for creators and collectors to identify themselves online. A DID can optionally be associated and verified with external linkages such as social media accounts and other real-world identifiers. **This allows creators to attach provenance to the history and origin of an NFT to distinguish authentic collections from copycats.**
