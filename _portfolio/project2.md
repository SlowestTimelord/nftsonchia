Royalties on secondary sales are one of the most attractive promises of NFTs to digital artists but on other chains this is enforced by centralized marketplaces that can (and have) changed their royalty enforcement policies at any time. **In Chia, the enforcement of royalties is embedded at the individual smart coin level and are enforced on-chain** on any sale using Offer Files. Note that transfers (moving an NFT from one address to another without the exchange of another asset) do not have royalties enforced to allow users to organize their assets freely.
