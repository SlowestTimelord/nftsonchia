Chia Offer Files are a trustless Peer-to-Peer mechanism to transact assets on the Chia blockchain without an intermediary party and with no counterparty risk. Offer Files also enforce royalties therefore there is no reliance on any middle parties (such as centralized marketplaces) to act as escrow. **Individuals can sell and trade their NFTs with others via any communication means** such as email, physical QR codes, social media, or [one of many DEXs and Offer Files discovery websites](https://chialinks.com/nfts/#marketplaces).
